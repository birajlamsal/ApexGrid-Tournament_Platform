You are building a PUBG PC tournament management website UI inspired by a modern esports stats site (reference: twire.gg PUBG section). Do NOT copy any text, logos, images, or exact styling tokens; recreate the layout patterns and UX with original assets and your own design system.

TECH STACK
- Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn/ui components
- lucide-react icons
- framer-motion animations (subtle)
- recharts for charts (radar chart is required)
- Data source: local mock JSON/TS objects (no backend). Put all mock data in /src/data

GLOBAL UI / DESIGN LANGUAGE
- Dark esports dashboard theme: near-black/charcoal background, layered panels, soft borders, slight gradient headers
- Single strong accent color (yellow/gold) + optional secondary (teal/blue) for highlights
- Cards: rounded-2xl, shadow-sm, thin border, hover lift + glow ring
- Typography: bold condensed headings, clean body text, very readable tables
- Layout baseline: 12-col grid on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Provide skeleton loaders and empty states for every data list/table

ROUTING (PAGES)
1) /pubg (Home / Hub)
   - Top sticky navbar: logo placeholder, primary nav (Tournaments, Ranking, News), search box, language dropdown, user menu button
   - Hero header with background image placeholder (use CSS gradient if no image), title “PUBG Hub”, quick stats chips
   - Sections (cards + horizontal carousels):
     a) Ongoing / Upcoming tournaments (scrollable row)
     b) Featured tournament highlight (big card with CTA)
     c) Latest news (3–6 cards)
   - Each section has “View all” link

2) /pubg/tournaments/ongoing (Tournaments list)
   - Header with filters bar:
     - Search input
     - Region dropdown
     - Tier dropdown
     - Status chips (Ongoing / Upcoming / Finished)
     - Sort dropdown (Start date, Prize pool, Popularity)
   - Tournament list as responsive cards:
     - Banner placeholder, title, date range, region tag, tier badge, prize pool, small meta row
     - CTA buttons: “Details” and “Leaderboards”
   - Pagination or infinite scroll (choose one), include skeleton loading

3) /pubg/tournaments/[tournamentId]/[slug] (Tournament detail)
   - Top “tournament header” section:
     - Left: tournament name, tier, region, date range
     - Right: stat tiles (teams, matches, prize pool, status)
   - Tab navigation (sticky when scrolling):
     - Overview
     - Leaderboards
     - Matches
     - Teams
     - Players
   - Tabs must sync with URL query (?tab=leaderboards etc.)

4) /pubg/tournaments/[tournamentId]/[slug]/leaderboards
   - A sticky FILTER BAR similar to esports stat sites:
     - Round dropdown
     - Group/Week dropdown
     - Day dropdown (optional)
     - Toggle: “Show qualified only”
     - Export button (dummy)
   - Main leaderboard table:
     Columns: Rank, Team (logo placeholder + name), Matches, WWCD, Kills, Placement Pts, Total Pts, Trend (▲▼)
     - Sticky header
     - Sortable columns (Total, Kills, Placement)
     - Row hover highlights + click to expand
   - Expanded row shows:
     - Mini match-by-match breakdown table (Match #, Map, Place, Kills, Pts)
     - A small “points split” bar visualization (placement vs kills)

5) /pubg/ranking/power-ranking (Power ranking)
   - Top controls:
     - Scope dropdown (Global / Region)
     - Time window dropdown (Last 30/90/All-time)
     - Role/metric dropdown
     - Search player/team
   - Layout:
     - “Top ranked” player cards grid (3–6 cards) each shows:
       - Player image placeholder
       - Overall score (big)
       - A radar chart (recharts RadarChart) with 5 axes (e.g., Attack, Utility, Survivor, Teammate, Finisher)
     - Below: full ranking table with same metrics columns + overall score
   - Keep charts performant; use dynamic import for recharts if needed

6) /pubg/news (News section)
   - Page header + category chips (All, Esports, Patch, Fantasy, Announcements)
   - Grid of article cards:
     - Thumbnail placeholder, title, short excerpt, date, tags
     - Hover: image zoom + card lift
   - /pubg/news/[postId]/[slug] detail page:
     - Article header, reading time, share buttons (dummy)
     - Content uses mock rich text blocks (headings, paragraphs, callout box)

COMPONENTS TO BUILD (REUSABLE)
- AppShell (navbar + layout)
- PageHeader (title + breadcrumbs + right-side actions)
- FilterBar (sticky, responsive: becomes drawer on mobile)
- StatTile, Badge, Chip, SkeletonCard
- DataTable (sorting, sticky header, row expand)
- TournamentCard, NewsCard, PlayerRankCard
- RadarStatCard (player portrait + radar + score)
- EmptyState (icon + message + CTA)

INTERACTIONS / UX
- Preserve filters in the URL query string (round, group, sort, search)
- Mobile behavior:
  - Tables become stacked “rows as cards”
  - Filters open in a bottom sheet/drawer
- Loading:
  - Skeletons shown for 1s simulated delay (setTimeout) to demonstrate states
- Accessibility:
  - Keyboard navigable table rows and menus
  - Proper aria labels for dropdowns, tabs, and drawers

PROJECT STRUCTURE
- /src/app/pubg/... routes above
- /src/components/ui (shadcn)
- /src/components (custom components)
- /src/data (mock tournaments, teams, players, matches, news)
- /src/lib (helpers: query params, sorting, formatters)
- Provide a clean README with setup + page map + where to edit mock data

DELIVERABLE
Generate the full codebase with all pages and components wired using mock data, matching the described esports dashboard look and behaviors.
